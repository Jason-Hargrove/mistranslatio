# "Mistranslatio" - Incorrect Spanish Translator

## Description

"Mistranslatio" is a fun and educational React and Node.js application that translates English text to Spanish, but with a twist. Instead of providing accurate translations, it intentionally returns incorrect translations by applying custom logic. This project is perfect for learning purposes, demonstrating API integration, frontend-backend communication, and basic error handling.

## Features

- **React Frontend**: Simple and user-friendly interface to input text and display incorrect translations.
- **Node.js and Express Backend**: Handles API requests and applies custom translation logic.
- **API Integration**: Utilizes the MyMemory Translation API to fetch translations.
- **Custom Translation Logic**: Modifies the correct translations to intentionally be incorrect.
- **Project Cleanup**: Streamlined project structure by removing unnecessary files.
